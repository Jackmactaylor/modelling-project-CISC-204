# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to our project for CISC/CMPE 204, a snakes and ladders game.
To run our game, you simply need to run the main.py file. Once you run main.py you will get a chance to play the game and read the game rules.

We use a few different encodings in our game, we added one of them to run.py and test.py so that those files will function.
the run.py files works normally, but the test.py file prints that we don't have enough variables in the encoding.
Please note that we do have more than ten variables across all our encodings, it is only displaying this message since the one encoding we provided only has six variables.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
